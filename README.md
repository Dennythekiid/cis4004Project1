# CIS 4004 — Project 1: HTML/CSS Resume on GitHub Pages (Denny Hernandez)

This site meets the structural requirements:
- Multi-page: `index.html`, `project-one.html`, `project-two.html`
- Semantic HTML landmarks (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`)
- Responsive CSS (no frameworks) and accessibility affordances (skip link, focus styles, alt text, proper headings)
- No frameworks used in this site per rubric (Bootstrap/React are only discussed as project content).

## How to deploy
1. Create a GitHub repo (or user site `<username>.github.io`).
2. Commit these files to the `main` branch.
3. Enable GitHub Pages in **Settings → Pages** (Deploy from a branch → `main` / root).
4. Validate:
   - W3C HTML: https://validator.w3.org/
   - WAVE Accessibility: https://wave.webaim.org/
